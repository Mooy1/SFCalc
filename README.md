# SFCalc
A calculator for the plugin Slimefun.

This addon for Slimefun adds a new command: /sfcalc. This command can calculate how much basic slimefun resources you need to make the specified item.

Usage: /sfcalc [required: item] [optional: amount]

Item is the id of the item you want to craft. An item id is like this: "electric_motor", "carbonado", "solar_generator" (basic solar generator), etc. For tiered machines that are not lowest tier, add the tier number after the id. For example: "solar_generator_3" (carbonado solar generator), "lava_generator_2" (advanced lava generator), "carbon_press" (carbon press [tier 1]), etc.

Amount is the number of items you want to craft. It defaults to 1 if you don't specify any amount.
